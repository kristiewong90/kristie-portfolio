          I approached my friend, Bree, a while ago and asked if she minded me redesigning her website as an example on my portfolio. She was actually ecstatic at the idea as she’s been thinking about rebranding her business. The purpose of this redesign (please keep in mind this is a work in progress) is for me to start thinking more as a UX /UI Designer. I want to implement some of the research I’ve done and apply it to this project. Below will outline my step by step process of redesigning and rebranding of Breeze Photography.

        <h3>what is the goal of the website?</h3>
