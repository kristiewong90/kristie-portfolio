          <h1>About me</h1>
          <br>
          <p>My background is a bit unusual. I studied Economics & Business at the University of Victoria.
            After graduating I found that wasn’t my passion. I entered into the web development at SAIT after
            many years of trying to find my passion. Web development is what sparked my interest in UX / UI
            design and digital marketing. That’s the direction I plan on taking my career in!</p>
