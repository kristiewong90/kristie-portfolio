          This is the path that led me to UX or UI Design. As mentioned in my bio, I left a job as a Junior Accountant trying to figure out what I was passionate about. It definitely wasn’t accounting or economics which is what I have an education or training in. I travelled for a bit hoping something would spark in me that would lead me down an enjoyable career path. The spark I got was more a of a dull flicker. I was actively blogging about my travels and was using WordPress. WordPress has it’s ups and downs which could be an entirely different blog post. Anyways, I didn’t end up writing that many blog posts because I was having more fun designing and redesigning the look and feel of my blog. I changed themes about four times and was in the process of researching how to make custom changes to the source code. But then my travels ended and so did my blog. However, my interest in web design remained.

          When I came back to Canada I knew I wanted to learn more. The whole world of IT was basically new to me. I looked up a few courses at SAIT and talked to an advisor. I told her I was interested in web design or graphic design. Her response was to apply for the Web Development program which would basically encompass my interest in web and graphic design, plus I would have knowledge of the back end. I listened to her and a few months later I was starting my first day of web development!

          I didn’t really know what to expect heading into the Web Development program. I had taken a computer course in my undergrad and had a tiny understanding of HTML and CSS. That made the first couple weeks breeze by. I developed stronger HTML and CSS skills and learned about responsive designs. Then we got into the server side. I was terrified PHP was going to be my demise, but I surprisingly didn’t hate it! I will say it’s definitely not my favourite or in this case, my passion.

          During my time in the Web Development program I had a chance to talk to a lot of people in the industry. Someone had asked me a short while ago what I wanted to do after I finished my program. I said to him, “Web Design!”. His response to me was, “Well, what does that mean? That could be anything? Do you want to do UX/UI Design or Front-End Development? Those all have web design aspects in them.” He caught me off guard a bit. I was naïve in thinking that a web design career was just making pretty layouts and style boards. After that conversation I went home and researched UX and UI design. This was when I got that spark I was hoping for. UX Designers have the ability to design products for a specific user and play on their emotions through their interactions. I just think that’s so interesting and innovated! And UI Designs compliment that by creating the visual representation of the product. The whole concept of UX Design is to think outside of the box and design experiences for users that are meaningful and memorable. This whole new world of design has just opened up to me and I couldn’t be more excited to explore it.
