        This is the path that led me to UX or UI Design. As mentioned in my bio, I left a job as a Junior Accountant trying to figure out what I was passionate about. It definitely wasnâ€™t accounting or economics which is what I have an education or training in. I travelled for a bit hoping something would spark in me that would lead me down an enjoyable career path. The spark I got was more a of a dull flicker. I was actively blogging about my travels and was using WordPress.
