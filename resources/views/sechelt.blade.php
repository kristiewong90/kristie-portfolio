          The purpose of this assignment was to redesign the <a href="http://www.secheltvisitorcentre.com">Sechlet Visitor Centre</a> website. Their current website is very dated and unresponsive. The requirements of this assignment were to use the Naked WordPress Theme and modify it using PHP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript to create a more appealing website.

        <h3>the challenge</h3>
        <p>
          The challenge on this assignment was deciphering the code on the Naked Theme. The plus side to the Naked Theme is that the code was nicely marked up. This made it easier to read and figure out where to place my modifications. Our instructor had provided us with all the content and images for the site. However, some of the images he provided were incredibly small and became really pixelated when enlarged. I ran out of time before I could find a solution to this problem. However, I think it this would have been an easy fix in photoshop (which I didn’t have on my computer at the time). I have a love/hate relationship with WordPress. Some of the plugins are great and make editing incredibly easy. But, on the other hand I feel more restricted with what I can do in some of the themes.

        <h3>what I learned</h3>
        <p>
          For this assignment I used the Page Builder plugin which I found very handy. It was really easy to use, and I was able to design layouts which could be reused. I also used the Max Mega Menu plugin which builds responsive navigation menus. To be honest, I discovered that plugins are your best friend, but finding the right plugin can be difficult. I tried a few and then tossed them because it didn’t have the functionality I was looking for. If I had more time on this assignment I would have liked to wipe the entire Naked Theme and start from scratch. I may attempt this with my Breeze Photography project!
